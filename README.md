# Spider CRM
My goal with this project is to experiment with different technologies, paradigms, and software development approaches.
I especially want to practice object oriented design in the context of a fullstack web app. Additionally, I also want to practice my UI/UX design and project management skills. I'll be more deliberate and organized with this project as a way for me to explore and practice product management from design to development.

For this project, I will:
- Craft user personas and use cases to inform product decisions
- Plan out a roadmap of features, components, and tasks
- Design low-fidelity wireframes as an initial proof of concept
- Develop the API fully before moving onto the frontend
- Rapidly develop an initial prototype
- Iterate and make changes to the roadmap
- Develop a style guide to inform the look and feel of the frontend
- Design high-fidelity mockups for the final product
- Build a functional full-stack product
- Test and review the application

The reason I chose to build a CRM is for various reasons. Firstly, it is because I have an interest in enterprise software. I want to become proficient in creating technological value for businesses and I figured this is a good side project for that goal.
Secondly, CRMs are good businesses. The recurring revenue that comes from high-value clients leads to a massive life-time value per customer. 

My intention for this project is to learn and practice my skills across the board. CRMs can be very robust and complicated pieces of software. There is a million directions I could go in with this project. For the sake of simplicity, I will be developing the absolute minimum core features of a B2B CRM. I will not bother with integrations or customizations as this project is not going into production, it is simply an exploration of different ways to build software and the process of doing so.

I think software should be developed in the context of the problem it solves, so I'll begin this project by creating a case that provides the context to inform my development.
