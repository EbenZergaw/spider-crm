# Spider CRM
My goal with this project is to experiment with different technologies, paradigms, and software development approaches.
I especially want to practice object oriented design. I've gotten used to functional design with the other projects
I've worked on and I now want to challenge myself with a different way of doing things. Additionally, I also want to practice my design and project management skills. I'll be more deliberate and organized with this project as a way for me to explore and practice product management from design to implementation.

For this project, I will:
- Scope, research, and map out the requirements of a simple CRM
- Plan out a roadmap of features, components, and tasks
- Design low-fidelity wireframes as an initial proof of concept
- Develop the API fully before moving onto the frontend
- Rapidly develop an initial prototype
- Iterate and make changes to the roadmap
- Develop a style guide to inform the look and feel of the product
- Design high-fidelity mockups for the final product
- Build a functional full-stack product

The reason I chose to build a CRM is for various reasons. Firstly, CRMs are good businesses. The recurring revenue that comes from high-value clients leads to a massive life-time value per customer. Another reason why I'm choosing to build a CRM is because I have an interest in enterprise software. I want to become proficient in creating technological value for businesses and I figured this is a good project for that goal.
