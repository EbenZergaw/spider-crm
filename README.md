# Spider CRM
My goal with this project is to experiment with object oriented design. I've gotten used to functional design with the other projects
I've worked on and I now want to challenge myself with a different way of doing things. Additionally, I also want to practice my design and project management skills. I'll be more deliberate and organized with this project as a way for me to explore and practice product management from design to implementation.
For this project, I will:
- Scope, research, and map out the requirements
- Develop a roadmap of features, components, and tasks
-
